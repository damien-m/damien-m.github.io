        <section class="cv-statement">
          <p>I’m a Frontend Developer with a passion for building delightful User Interfaces that are built mobile first, responsive and work anywhere a browser is installed. I build components and from them compose Apps. I like to put the user first, thinking about making their experience better, even if it means more development work for myself.
            <br /> I'm happy working on the backend too, having recently used Node/Express but I've also worked with Ruby/Rails and PHP. I'm happiest when I can use a keyboard shortcut and love the power of the command line for running build tools, pushing commits to Github, checking logs, configuring Nginx, installing SSL certificates or writing DB queries.
            <br /> I always like to keep one eye on the future and I'm excited about Web Components, Service Workers and the Web being able to compete with Native experiences.</p>
