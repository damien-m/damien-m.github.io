          <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
          <p>I’m a Frontend Developer with a passion for building delightful User Interfaces that are built mobile first, responsively and work anywhere a browser is installed.</p>
          <p>I build components and from there Apps seem to grow. I’m happy working on backend things too, preferably in Javascript but have dabbled in Ruby and PHP.</p>
          <p>I’ve been known to tinker with Apache, Nginx and have been spotted writing queries in MySQL, PostGres and Mongo.</p>
          <p>The command line is a beautiful if esoteric place and it’s where I like to run my build tools, manage servers and install SSL certificates amongst other things.</p>
